## Info
This is a <SCP SL Exiled 2> plugin that allows for the facility to have a "Door Software Restart". 
The plugin closes and full locks all doors for the configurated time and then unlocks them again.

Rumors say that these "glitches" happen because someone spilled their coffee on the system in a rush to leave the facility.
